I made a rock paper scissors game because I like rock paper scissors and I've used it as a coin toss mechanism in real life to make decisions. 
I added game modes to make it more interesting and I made a class to make adding game modes a little easier.
I learned about psuedo-css code with the buttons to customize them a bit and correct unintended formatting when adding bootstrap. 
This was also a fun exercise in flex box. because I overcoded and it was bad. so I dialed back and simplified it and it worked out a  lot better.
